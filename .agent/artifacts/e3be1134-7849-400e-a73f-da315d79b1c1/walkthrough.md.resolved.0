# Walkthrough - Environment and Connectivity Assurance Skill Integration

I have successfully integrated the `Environment and Connectivity Assurance` skill (`LACG-ENV-v2.0`) into the project.

## Changes Made

### Skill Definition
- Created [SKILL.md](file:///c:/laragon/www/abastible/.agent/skills/env-assurance/SKILL.md) which includes:
    - **E-V2H:** Strict parity environment integrity rules.
    - **T-CAS:** Connectivity assurance protocols for DB and Vite.
    - **L-SAPE:** Autonomous adaptation logic for drift and permissions.

### Helper Scripts
- Created [check_connectivity.php](file:///c:/laragon/www/abastible/.agent/skills/env-assurance/scripts/check_connectivity.php) to automate connectivity validation as per the T-CAS module.

## Verification Results

### Connectivity Check
I performed a check to ensure the script correctly identifies the environment settings:
- The script successfully reads `.env` variables.
- It attempts to connect to the database and Vite port, providing recovery suggestions if they are unreachable.

### Skill Accessibility
- The skill is structured correctly and located in the project's `.agent/skills` directory, making it available for future operations.
